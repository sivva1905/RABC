    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      This project focuses on implementing <strong>Authentication</strong>, 
      <strong>Authorization</strong>, and <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>. 
      It manages user access securely and ensures role-specific permissions to application features.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <div>
      <h4>Authentication</h4>
      <p>
        - Secure user registration with input validation and password hashing using bcrypt.<br>
        - User login with email and password, generating secure JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.<br>
        - Logout functionality with token invalidation for added security.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h4>Authorization</h4>
      <p>
        - Middleware to validate JWTs and decode user roles.<br>
        - Role-based endpoint protection to ensure only authorized users can access certain resources.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h4>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h4>
      <p>
        - Two predefined roles: <strong>User</strong> and <strong>Admin</strong>.<br>
        - Middleware to enforce access control based on roles.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <h3>Implementation Highlights</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        - <strong>Backend:</strong> Developed using Node.js with Express.js for fast and scalable server-side operations.<br>
        - <strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB for flexible and efficient data management.<br>
        - <strong>Authentication Protocols:</strong> JWT-based authentication with robust middleware.<br>
        - <strong>RBAC Middleware:</strong> Ensures efficient route protection based on user roles.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <h3>Security Enhancements</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        - HTTPS for secure communication.<br>
        - Rate-limiting to mitigate brute force attacks.<br>
        - Token expiration and refresh mechanisms for secure session management.
      </p>
